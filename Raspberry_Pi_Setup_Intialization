Setting up for Headless Install
    # No monitor. No mouse. No keyboard.
    # Install k3s kubernetes
    # Install Rancher
    
Minimum Requirements:
	Raspberry Pi 4 2GB RAM
	Power Supply
	SD Card
	Micro SD USB Adapter
	An IP address on your subnet that isn't getting used
	The IP address of your default gateway for your network 
	Your subnet mask
	A name for you new headless Pi
	Your network interface value (eth0 or equivalent)
	Ethernet connection to your network

Prepare the SD Card by putting the Raspian Image onto your SD Card
    Slide the SD Card into the back slot of the Micro SD USB Adapter
    Plug into your computer
    Go to  https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/
    Download, then Install the Raspberry Pi Imager for your operating system
    # You might need to go into your applications to double click the big raspberry imager after it's downloaded
    Select: Raspberry Pi OS Lite 32 BIT version
    Hit Ctl Shift X and select SSH
    Change user name if you want from pi and create your password
    # This is SUPER Important - Raspberry Pi's manufactured after April 2022 no longer have a default password for SSH
    # You MUST set your credentials HERE to get in later using the password you established here.
    Select Storage (make sure you write the image to your 
    Save the image to your 32GB Micro SD Card
    Hit Write
    Wait until complete, then
    
    Remove the USB Adapter from your computer
    Remove the SD Card from the USB Adapter
    Put the SD Card into the slot on your Raspberry Pi (Pi4 SD Slot is at the back underneath)
    Power up your Pi now with the SD Card in it
    # Look for the Red light ON to indicate power connected.
    # Flashing intermittently green light is GOOD
    # One or just two blinks means there's a problem. We'll deal with that later.

After a few minutes waiting for the Pi to boot itself up, the green light will display a few flashes now and again
    Go ahead and unplug power from the Pi
    Remove the SD Card from the Pi
    Insert it BACK in the USB Adapter
    And plug the USB Adapter BACK into your computer.
    Search on your computer file manager forBoot(I:) (which is your Eye Drive right??)

All this is doing is creating a Boot Folder on the Drive
And now we need to modify a few of those files to prepare the Pi for a Headless life of Adventure!

Open up the Boot folder 
	Find the cmdline.txt file and click on it in your text editor
	And here you'll see a big long line of text 
	Go to the very end and
            # after rootwait
            type in 
            "cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory ip=xx.x.x.xx::xx.x.x.xx:255.255.255.0:newPIname:eth0:off"
            Type ctl_s to save this code to the file
            # where 
            the first IP address is A) on your subnet and B) isn't used AND
            after the :: the ip address of the default gateway of your network AND
            whatever your subnet mask is for your network AND
            Here you name your headless Pi AND
            Add your interface (NIC) AND
            Off being to turn off auto configuration
            
        NEXT: Find the config.txt file
        Open it in your text editor of choice
        Scroll down to the very end of the file
        Type the following on a new line
        	arm_64bit=1
        	# We need this ensure that we're using a 64bit version of raspian which will default to 32bit if we don't specify it.
        	
Next -  Go to your Command Line, Power Shell or Terminal
        CD into the Boot(I:) and create a new empty file called ssh 
        # This will enable SSH so that we can SSH into the Raspberry Pi the next time it boots up.
        # In CMD you can hit I: enter and then type in "new-item ssh"
        # In Terminal you can type "touch ssh" to create the new empty file   
        
Next -  Remove the SD Card from your USB slot and USB Adapter
	Put the SD Card in your Pi
	Add power to the Pi
	Plug in your ethernet cable to the Pi
	Wait for the Pi to boot up
	While waiting, open up your CMD or Terminal
	Ping your IP Address you assigned in the cmdline.txt file
	# ping 10.10.0.3
	Once established your Pi is alive - it's time to SSH into it!
	
SSH -   In your terminal - the default Pi username is "pi" and the password you set up in the Imager Utility
        ssh pi@10.10.0.3 (whatever IP address you assigned) and hit ENTER
        # Note "pi" is the default user name assigned at the factory - so if you changed it now is the time...
        # You will get a warning that the authenticity of your host cannot be established
        # There's an ECDSA key fingerprint for security and the system asks if you want to connect.
        Type "yes" and hit Enter
        The system then asks for the password
        You are in!!!
  
  Once in I took a moment to update the Raspberry on terminal with the following command:
  	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  	# I'm not sure if this was a mistake or not. If it was I will have to re-image the Pi and start over.
  	# I will update this file as I progress
  	
  Install K3S now by typing in the following command:
  
       curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
       
       Check out your new Kubernetes cluster using the following command:
       kubectl get pods -A
       and VOILA! 
  
  Below is TBD for now: Updates coming soon!
  
        
# To config your headless Pi you must config using ROOT. In your machine on terminal 
        Type "sudo su -" without the "'s
        Hit Enter
        # You should now see "root@raspberrypi:~# in the command line
        And with that we then update the iptables.

Updating IP Tables in Terminal. K3S is going to need the iptables so we need to update them:
	Type "sudo iptables -F"
	You can copy the following and paste it into your terminal/CMD
	
bin/iptable-legacy
sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacyroot@raspberrypi:~# sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy update-alternatives: using /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy to provide /usr/sbin/iptables (iptables) in manual mode
root@raspberrypi:~# sudo update-alternatives --set ip6tables /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy
update-alternatives: using /usr/sbin/ip6tables-legacy to provide /usr/sbin/ip6tables (ip6tables) in manual mode
	
Then type "reboot" to reboot your headless Pi machine
	# You're done configuring your headless Pi! 
	
Now it's time to install Kubernetes (K3S) on your headless Pi
	We need to set up the MASTER first.
	Launch Terminal
	ssh into your pi
	Type ssh pi@10.x.x.x
	Enter the password (default raspberry for now)
	Type "sudo su -" to become ROOT
	Hit Enter
	As ROOT type in the following command into your terminal
	"curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" sh -s"
	Hit ENTER and wait for the download
	# We are going to download the kubernetes script (get.k3s.io) where the magic is happening
	# and then we're going to configure the Pi to install Rancher (wait...what????) More on Rancher later - just do this.
	
kubectl  CubeKuttle is what we will use a lot to do everything
Let's verify everything is working type "kubectl get nodes" and hit ENTER
